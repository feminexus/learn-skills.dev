name: agent-skill-authoring
description: The ability to author, structure, name, refine, split, and audit agent skills in the agentskills.io format under the host project's skill root (e.g., `.claude/skills/`). Covers capability framing (naming and voice that present a skill as an ability, not a document), frontmatter and invocation-control fields, kebab-case naming, writing `description`/`when_to_use` for discovery, section anatomy with concise examples plus RFC-2119 guideline bullets, progressive disclosure into reference files, topic-based cross-references, archetype skeletons for the project skills a scaffolding pass creates (structure, component, UI/design), and a runnable structure validator.
when_to_use: Apply whenever creating, refining, restructuring, splitting, consolidating, renaming, deleting, or auditing an agent skill — drafting a `SKILL.md`, editing frontmatter, tightening a `description`, deciding where a new rule belongs, running the structure validator, or refreshing a skill's discovery metadata. Use for "add a skill", "split this skill", "audit skills", "recast this skill as a capability", or any change to `SKILL.md` files or their references.

# Agent Skill Authoring

Use this capability whenever you create, refine, split, consolidate, rename, or audit an agent skill under the host project's skill root. It is what turns a durable convention into a well-formed, discoverable skill and keeps the skill tree coherent as it grows.

Skills authored here follow the agentskills.io format. For the host project's active skill inventory and topic-to-skill routing, defer to each skill's own `description`/`when_to_use` discovery metadata and the directory listing under the skill root; where a host also maintains a written index (e.g. `AGENTS.md`), keep it in sync too.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST run the bundled `scripts/check-skill.mjs` validator over every skill a change touches; it is the enforcement path for the frontmatter, naming, discovery length-cap, and reference-linkage rules this skill states nowhere else (see [audit-checklist.md](./references/audit-checklist.md)).
- SHOULD propose or implement a skill update when any task exposes a reusable convention, outdated guidance, a recurring review issue, or a missing project rule — skill maintenance happens when work reveals durable learning, not after every narrow fix.
- SHOULD skip skill maintenance when the work produced no generalizable learning, and state that it was skipped.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.html).

## Scoping and MECE

See [scoping-and-mece.md](./references/scoping-and-mece.md) for:

- choosing a coherent skill boundary, skill name, split, consolidation, or source-of-truth location
- checking overlap with neighboring skills before adding new guidance
- using section length and topic growth as signals for restructuring

## Capability Framing

See [capability-framing.md](./references/capability-framing.md) for:

- framing a skill as an ability the agent gains rather than a document it reads
- naming the activity a skill enables, and the document-style suffixes to avoid
- the voice of the `description` opening clause, the H1, and the opening paragraph
- recasting an existing guideline-style skill in a fixed order, without changing what it requires

## Frontmatter and Naming

See [frontmatter-and-naming.md](./references/frontmatter-and-naming.md) for:

- creating or editing discovery-critical `SKILL.md` frontmatter
- setting the invocation-control fields (`when_to_use`, `argument-hint`, `arguments`, `user-invocable`, `disable-model-invocation`) by skill archetype — guideline skill vs workflow entry point
- choosing the skill directory name and keeping it aligned with the `name` field
- porting or preserving host-project harness fields

## Description Writing

See [description-writing.md](./references/description-writing.md) for:

- drafting, trimming, or auditing the `description` and `when_to_use` fields
- splitting what the skill covers (`description`) from when to apply it (`when_to_use`), within the length caps
- adding likely user phrasings and symptom-based triggers without over-broadening the skill

## Body Content Style

See [body-content-style.md](./references/body-content-style.md) for:

- writing or revising substantive skill-body or reference-file sections
- balancing concise topic explanation, examples, and guideline bullets
- placing normative RFC-2119 requirement bullets in detailed reference content rather than parent routing sections

## Progressive Disclosure

See [progressive-disclosure.md](./references/progressive-disclosure.md) for:

- deciding when a skill should stay single-file or split into `references/`
- the size thresholds that signal a skill or reference file has grown too large
- using the parent routing-section format: `## Topic`, `See [file.md](./references/file.md) for:`, then descriptive situation bullets
- keeping parent routing bullets free of RFC-2119-style requirement keywords so they remain routing cues, not duplicated rules

## Cross-Referencing and Discovery

See [cross-referencing.md](./references/cross-referencing.md) for:

- adding, renaming, moving, deleting, or linking skills and reference files
- choosing one source of truth instead of copying detailed rules across skills
- using topic-based cross-skill references, verifying intra-skill relative links, and keeping skill discovery current (plus any written index a host maintains)

## Project Skill Archetypes

See [project-skill-archetypes.md](./references/project-skill-archetypes.md) for:

- creating the project-specific skills a scaffolding pass calls for: structure, component, and UI/design
- the three-way ownership triangle and each archetype's skeleton, topics checklist, or table patterns
- growing archetype skeletons with worked examples and mechanical boundary checks

## Auditing and Validation

See [audit-checklist.md](./references/audit-checklist.md) for:

- auditing multiple skills or reporting skill-tree quality
- running the bundled structure validator (`scripts/check-skill.mjs`) to check frontmatter, naming, discovery length caps, reference linkage, and routing-section format mechanically
- checking inventory, skill discovery, section anatomy, RFC-2119 bullets, topic-based cross-skill references, and relative links
- identifying overlap, stale assumptions, orphan references, and missing source-of-truth links
