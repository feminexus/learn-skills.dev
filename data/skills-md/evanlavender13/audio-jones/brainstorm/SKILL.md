# Brainstorm & Research

Turn a vague idea into a researched concept through collaborative dialogue. Explore together, then fetch real references and write a research document.

## Core Principles

- **Explore, don't eliminate**: "Both" is a valid answer. Build up constraints, don't force binary choices.
- **One question at a time**: Multiple choice preferred. Open-ended when needed.
- **Propose approaches with recommendations**: Present 2-3 options, lead with your pick and why.
- **No hallucinated implementations**: Real references or stop.
- **Preserve reference code verbatim**: When the user provides working shader/code or you fetch it from a source, include the EXACT code in the research doc under a `## Reference Code` section. Do NOT paraphrase, summarize, or rewrite it into pseudocode. Implementing agents WILL invent broken alternatives if they only see prose descriptions.
- **One approach in the output**: Pick the best fit. No "alternatively..." sections.
- **Look for parameter synergies**: Don't just list what wiggles. Identify where parameters *interact* to create emergent dynamics — gating, tension, resonance between modulated values.

## Phase 1: Orient

**Goal**: Understand starting point and context

@docs/effects.md

**Actions**:
1. Check `docs/research/` for existing research on this topic
2. If $ARGUMENTS is blank: ask what visual quality or mood they want to explore
3. If $ARGUMENTS has an idea: restate it in one sentence, naming closest existing effects with exact subcategory placement from the injected inventory above

---

## Phase 2: Explore

**Goal**: Build up understanding through dialogue

**Actions**:
1. Ask questions one at a time. Prefer multiple choice (2-4 options) when possible.
2. Frame questions as "and/or" not "either/or" when both could apply:
   - "Geometric, organic, or a blend?"
   - "Subtle enhancement or dramatic transformation?"
   - "Sharp/crisp or soft/diffused?"
3. Accept compound answers. "Both" or "somewhere between" are progress, not failure to narrow.
4. After 3-5 exchanges, summarize what you've learned about:
   - Visual goal (what it looks like)
   - Motion behavior (how it animates over time, if at all)
   - Constraints (what it must or must not do)
5. As the design takes shape, actively look for **parameter interaction patterns** — places where two or more parameters create emergent dynamics when modulated together:
   - **Cascading thresholds**: Parameter A must reach a level before Parameter B produces visible output. Different audio bands gate each other — sections of a song unlock visual layers that quieter sections hide entirely. (Example: constellation wave amplitude gates triangle fill visibility.)
   - **Competing forces**: Two parameters push in opposite directions. The visual result shows their tension — neither dominates, and the balance shifts with the music.
   - **Resonance/alignment**: Two parameters amplify each other when they coincide. Peaks only appear when both values spike together, creating rare bright moments.
   These patterns make modulation produce song-reactive dynamics (verse looks different from chorus) rather than static or cyclical visuals. Note promising interactions for the research document.

**Note**: Skip audio reactivity questions—all parameters expose to modulation engine. Users configure their own routes. The interaction patterns above are about *structural relationships between parameters*, not about which audio source maps where.

**STOP**: Do not proceed until concept direction is clear enough to research.

## Phase 3: Classify

**Goal**: Determine domain type for research

**Actions**:
1. Classify into one domain:

| Type | Characteristics | Example |
|------|----------------|---------|
| Effect (Transform) | Reads input texture, outputs modified pixels | Kuwahara, kaleidoscope |
| Effect (Feedback) | Reads previous frame, accumulates over time | Flow field, blur |
| Effect (Output) | Post-process after transforms | Chromatic aberration, bloom |
| Simulation | Per-agent or field-based compute, writes to texture | Physarum, boids, curl flow |
| Drawable | Generates geometry drawn to accumulation buffer | Waveforms, particle trails |
| General | Software/architecture, not a visual pipeline component | UI redesign, serialization |

2. Present classification with one sentence explaining why.

3. Read memories from `MEMORY.md` matching the classified domain.

**STOP**: Do not proceed until user confirms classification.

---

## Phase 4: Research

**Goal**: Find real, fetchable references

**Actions**:
1. Search with WebSearch, prioritizing bot-friendly sources:
   - Inigo Quilez articles (iquilezles.org)
   - GPU Gems chapters
   - Catlike Coding tutorials
   - Academic papers (GDC, SIGGRAPH)
   - GitHub shader repositories
   - Godot Shaders

2. **Blocked sites** (do NOT attempt to fetch):
   - **Shadertoy**: ask user to paste shader code AND provide attribution info (see below)
   - **Wikipedia**: ask user to paste relevant section
   - Tell them: "[Site] blocks automated access. Paste the relevant content from [URL]"

3. **Shadertoy attribution (REQUIRED)**: When the user pastes Shadertoy code, you MUST collect:
   - **Shader title** (from the Shadertoy page)
   - **Author name** (Shadertoy username)
   - **Shadertoy URL** (e.g. `https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XXXX`)
   - **License** (default is CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 unless stated otherwise in the shader)
   - If the user doesn't provide these, ASK before proceeding. Do not skip this.

3. Fetch promising URLs. For each attempt, report:
   - Fetched: URL loaded, key content
   - Blocked: bot detection, paywall, timeout
   - Not attempted: reason

4. If ALL fetches fail: **STOP**. Ask user to provide a source or paste code.

5. **Pick one approach.** If multiple sources describe different methods, select the one that best fits this codebase's complexity level and pipeline. State why. Do not document alternatives.

## Phase 5: Compatibility Gate

**Goal**: Verify the technique works in this pipeline

### Effect (Transform/Feedback/Output)
- Reads input texture? Compatible.
- Ignores input, generates procedurally? Incompatible as transform. Propose adaptation or reclassify.

### Simulation
- Per-agent with trails? Follows Physarum/Boids pattern (compute shader + trail texture).
- Field-based (no agents)? Follows Curl Advection pattern (texture ping-pong).
- Requires 3D geometry or mesh? Incompatible.

### Drawable
- Produces 2D geometry (lines, points, shapes)? Draws to accumulation buffer.
- Requires depth buffer or 3D? Incompatible.

### General
- No compatibility gate. Proceed.

**STOP**: Do not proceed until user approves compatibility.

## Phase 6: Write Research Document

**Goal**: Create `docs/research/<name>.md`

**Actions**:
1. Write document following the template below
2. Include ONLY the researched approach—no alternatives section

### Template

```markdown
# [Name]

[One paragraph: what the viewer sees or what emerges]

## Classification

- **Category**: [e.g. TRANSFORMS > Warp, SIMULATIONS, GENERATORS > Texture]
- **Pipeline Position**: [From inventory pipeline order]
- **Compute Model**: [Compute shader + trail texture / Texture ping-pong] (simulations only)

## Attribution

If this effect derives from a Shadertoy shader or other CC-licensed source:

- **Based on**: "[Shader Title]" by [Author]
- **Source**: [URL]
- **License**: [CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 / other]

Omit this section if the effect is original or based only on academic techniques.

## References

- [Title](URL) - [What this source provides]

## Reference Code

Include the EXACT working code from references here — user-pasted Shadertoy shaders, fetched GLSL snippets, algorithm implementations. This is the source of truth for implementing agents. Do NOT paraphrase or rewrite into pseudocode.

```glsl
// Paste complete reference code here, unmodified
```

## Algorithm

[Adaptation notes: what changes are needed to fit this codebase's conventions.]
- What to keep verbatim from the reference code above
- What to replace (e.g., "replace hsl2rgb with gradient LUT sampling", "replace iChannel0 feedback with ping-pong render textures")
- Parameter mapping from reference defines/constants to config struct fields

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Range | Default | Effect |
|-----------|------|-------|---------|--------|

## Modulation Candidates

- **parameter**: what changes visually when modulated

### Interaction Patterns

Document parameter pairs with cascading threshold, competing forces, or resonance dynamics (defined in Phase 2). If no meaningful interactions exist, omit this section.

**DO NOT prescribe audio sources or mapping recommendations. Users configure their own modulation routes.**

## Notes

[Caveats, performance, edge cases]
```

For drawables or general features: use the template above, adjusted for the domain. Skip pipeline position for general features.

## Phase 7: Summary

**Actions**:
1. Tell user:
   - Research document location
   - Classification
   - "To plan implementation: `/feature-plan docs/research/<name>.md`"

---

## Output Constraints

- ONLY create `docs/research/<name>.md`
- Do NOT create plan documents
- Do NOT proceed past gates without user approval
- Do NOT present alternative approaches in the research doc
- Do NOT hallucinate algorithms—real references or stop

## Red Flags - STOP

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "They need to pick one or the other" | "Both" is valid. Explore the combination. |
| "I'll skip exploration, the idea is clear" | Phase 2 builds shared understanding. Do it. |
| "I can invent the algorithm" | Real references only. Ask for sources if fetches fail. |
| "I'll describe the algorithm in prose" | Include the EXACT reference code. Agents invent broken alternatives from prose. |
| "I'll include multiple approaches in the doc" | One approach. The chosen one. |
| "This technique is obviously compatible" | Run the compatibility gate anyway. |
| "I know what they want" | Ask. One question at a time. |
