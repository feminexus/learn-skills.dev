# Clarifying Question Discipline

> Internal shared skill. Referencing workflows declare it in frontmatter `dependencies` and abort at startup if it is missing — no silent fallback.

## The hard discipline: one question per round, multiple rounds until clear

When information is insufficient to guarantee output quality, ask the user **exactly ONE most critical question per round**, then wait for the answer before continuing (or asking the next one).

- **Priority order for picking the question**: purpose → constraints → success criteria.
- **Multi-round by design**: when several unknowns exist (purpose, constraints, success criteria all missing), resolve them across **multiple rounds** — each round's question is refined by the previous answer. This discipline does NOT mean "only one question for the whole session"; it means one question per message, iterating until the information is sufficient.
- **Clarify first, answer later**: clarification rounds exist to make the problem clear. Do **not** rush to provide solutions, conclusions, or a full answer while critical unknowns remain. Analyze and answer after the problem is sufficiently clear (or the user explicitly asks to proceed / answer now).
- **Unconditional**: this discipline always applies; it does not depend on optional enhancement skills being installed.

**Forbidden**: asking multiple questions in one message; listing several open points for the user to answer one by one; treating「一问一答」as “ask then immediately solve” (use「一次一问、多轮问清」/ one-per-turn + multi-round-until-clear instead).

**Why**: multi-question dumps increase user cognitive load, cause missed answers, and diffuse the AI's focus. One-at-a-time converges progressively — each question is refined by the previous answer. Rushing to answer during clarification solves the wrong problem.

## Question format

Describe intent; the agent picks its own native capability (platform-agnostic, per repo rules):

- Prefer the agent's **native structured-question capability** (single question + multiple options); fall back to plain prose when unavailable.
- Do NOT hardcode a platform-specific tool, and do NOT enumerate "platform X uses tool A, platform Y uses tool B".

```
[One sentence stating the question clearly]
- A option one
- B option two
Recommended: A (brief rationale)
```

**Recommended answer (mandatory when a reasonable default exists):** every question MUST include a recommended option or stated default with a one-line rationale, so the user can accept quickly or override. MUST NOT ask a bare open question with no suggested resolution when a default is knowable.

**Short-answer convention**: the user may reply with just an option letter ("A", "B"); parse it and continue.

## Fact self-check versus decision ask-human

Before spending the one-question slot:

1. **Fact self-check** — if the needed fact is readable from the repo, already-referenced files, or prior user messages, verify it yourself; do **not** ask the user to restate it.
2. **Decision ask-human** — reserve user questions for preferences, product/tech decisions, unavailable context, or confirmations that cannot be derived from evidence you already have.

## Investigation-first principle

1. **Investigate before speaking** — for uncertain questions, investigate first, then advise. No investigation, no say.
2. **Evidence over assumptions** — speak with data, facts, and evidence; avoid void hypotheses.

## Integration guide (for referencing workflows)

A referencing workflow keeps exactly three touchpoints in its own body (per spec `clarifying-question-discipline`); the full discipline text lives only here:

1. **Prominent pointer** — a bold/tagged one-line declaration that names this skill and the intent **one-per-turn + multi-round until clear + clarify-first**. Prefer: `⚠️ 主动提问：遵循 clarifying-question-discipline（一次一问、多轮问清；问清优先，不急着答）。` / `⚠️ Follow clarifying-question-discipline (one question per turn; multi-round until clear; clarify first, do not rush to answer).` Do **not** use「一问一答」; do **not** restate the purpose→constraints→success priority chain or invent shorter paraphrases that can be read as "only one question for the whole session".
2. **Entry-point quantity constraint** — at each user-questioning step (e.g. "list open questions"), explicitly state "if asking the user, ask only ONE most critical question this turn; ask the next only after the answer".
3. **Red Flags entry** — "dumping multiple questions/open points on the user at once" and "rushing to answer/solve during clarification" listed as forbidden, with the one-at-a-time / clarify-first fix.

Skills that do NOT declare the dependency (e.g. standalone English skills) instead inline the full form themselves (prominent declaration + entry constraint + Red Flags + platform-agnostic phrasing).
