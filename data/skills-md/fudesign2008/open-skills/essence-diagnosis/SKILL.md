# Essence Diagnosis

> **Role**: Performs essence analysis and diagnosis of complex problems only. Produces a complete evidence chain + logic chain + hypothesis list. **Does NOT solve the problem** (no solutions, no execution, no fixes). Must orchestrate `multi-agent-debate` for adversarial verification.
>
> **Output templates and formats** are in [reference.md](reference.md).

## Why this skill exists

Faced with complex problems (massive logs, intertwined factors, disconnect between symptoms and essence), both humans and AI tend to make the same mistake: **stopping at the first explanation that looks like a root cause**. This is premature convergence. Once converged, all subsequent analysis becomes "proving myself right" — confirmation bias kicks in, counterexamples are ignored, alternative explanations are discarded.

The sole value of this skill is to fight these two cognitive traps with a structured process, turning "I think it's X" into "the evidence chain points to X, and Y/Z have been falsified". It does not do repair. It delivers a diagnosis report that survives adversarial verification.

## Relationship to other skills

| Skill | Responsibility | Relationship to this skill |
|-------|---------------|----------------------------|
| `solve-workflow` | Full workflow (analyze → solution → execute → verify → recap) | This skill is the heavy-weight deep-dive of its phase 1.2, focused purely on analysis/diagnosis; can also be used standalone |
| `multi-agent-debate` | Three-agent adversarial verification of existing conclusions | This skill's output = its input; **one-way orchestration**, debate does not call back into this skill |
| `diagnose` / `debug-workflow` | Single-bug diagnosis/debugging | They assume "known to be a bug"; this skill makes no such assumption and fits the foggy state of "not even sure what the problem is yet" |
| `hybrid-debug` | Hybrid app (WebView/WKWebView/Electron + H5) four-layer debugging | Domain-specific pre-filter: for hybrid problems, apply its four-layer model first; escalate to this skill only when the problem is still foggy after structured layer-by-layer analysis |

## Triggers and mode

**Triggers**: 本质诊断, 根因诊断, 深度诊断, 诊断问题本质, 梳理问题逻辑, 证据链分析, 逻辑链分析, essence-diagnosis

**Default**: When the user invokes it, the problem is assumed to be complex — no complexity-threshold gate is applied.

## Methodology backbone

Three-source fusion (all backed by mature industry practice, not invented from scratch):

| Source | Borrowed mechanism | Role in this skill |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Medical differential diagnosis (DDx) | SOAP format + parallel hypotheses + VINDICATE categorization | Process backbone (S/O/A three sections) + forced exhaustive hypotheses |
| Strong inference (Platt) | Parallel hypothesis **falsification** (not confirmation), falsifiability (Popper) | Hypothesis-testing mechanism — hunt counterexamples, not supporters |
| Fault tree / accident investigation | Top-down causal backtracking, evidence-support matrix | Logic-chain visualization |

## Core flow: S → O → A → Debate

### S — Subjective: information-field collection and denoising

Goal: extract structurally from a chaotic information field — **do not accept everything wholesale**. The essence of a complex problem is that signal is drowned by noise; denoising is step one.

1. **Source inventory**: logs, code, docs, metrics, configs, user feedback, meeting notes, git history… list every available information source
2. **Denoising**: dedupe, align by time, sort by relevance, flag obvious noise
3. **Output**: a list of objective facts (each with a source `file:line` / `cmd` / `N samples`)

> Why denoise before forming hypotheses? Because reading logs with a head full of hypotheses, you only see the lines that support them — that is the entry point for confirmation bias. Forming hypotheses during denoising is strictly forbidden.

### O — Objective: multi-hypothesis generation and evidence-chain construction

Goal: **force multiple hypotheses** to fight premature convergence.

1. **Hypothesis generation (≥3)**: walk each category of the VINDICATE general taxonomy (see reference.md); at least one hypothesis per category
2. **Build an evidence chain for each hypothesis**: use the Toulmin argument model (see reference.md); all 6 elements must be complete
3. **Evidence-hypothesis separation**: collect evidence first, then match to hypotheses; never "form a hypothesis then hunt for evidence"
4. **No source, no conclusion**: every piece of evidence must cite the original text + line number / command output / sample count, otherwise it is discarded

> Why ≥3? With only one hypothesis you unconsciously collect only supporting evidence; with two you pick the more comfortable one; with three or more you actually compare. This is a century-old rule of thumb in differential diagnosis.

### A — Assessment: logic-chain assembly and bias counter-attack

Goal: assemble the evidence chain into a logic chain, and actively look for flaws in your own work.

1. **Logic-chain construction**: top-down causal backtracking (fault tree, see reference.md); every causal link needs evidence support
2. **Bias counter-attack check**: for each hypothesis, walk through the 4-item bias checklist (below)
3. **Weakest-link identification**: pick the 2-3 weakest links in the logic chain — these are the targets handed to debate
4. **Physical verification design**: every conclusion must map to an executable verification command or experiment

### Orchestrate multi-agent-debate (hard constraint, not optional)

After S/O/A complete, **must** invoke `multi-agent-debate` for adversarial verification. This is a hard constraint of this skill.

**Handoff package** (format in reference.md):
- One-paragraph primary hypothesis
- Evidence list (each with a source tag)
- 2-3 weakest links

When debate returns its conclusions, update the "Confirmed Facts / Reasonable Inferences / Unresolved Disputes" sections of the diagnosis report.

> Why must it go through debate? No matter how rigorous S/O/A are, they are pushed by a single analyst and will have blind spots. Debate uses three adversarial perspectives (Defender / Challenger / Evidence Hunter) to forcibly break the single viewpoint and adjudicate reasoning disputes with physical evidence.

## Evidence-chain hard constraints

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| **No source, no conclusion** | "Evidence" without an original-text citation is a hotbed of hallucination — LLMs will fabricate plausible-looking citations |
| **Toulmin 6 elements** (Claim / Data / Warrant / Backing / Qualifier / Rebuttal) | Forces every conclusion to be decomposed to an auditable granularity; Rebuttal forces you to actively imagine counterexamples |
| **Evidence tags**: `[FACT:file:line]` `[FACT:cmd]` `[FACT:N samples]` `[INFERENCE]` `[UNRESOLVED]` | Facts and inferences must be visually separable, otherwise inferences quietly mutate into "facts" |
| **Evidence-hypothesis separation** | Evidence first, hypotheses second — avoids hypothesis contamination of evidence collection |

## Bias counter-attack checklist

In phase A, check each hypothesis against every item:

| Bias | Symptom | Counter-measure |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| **Confirmation bias** | Only collecting evidence that supports the hypothesis | Force each hypothesis to list ≥2 counter-evidence items; finding no counter-evidence is itself a danger signal |
| **Premature convergence** | Stopping at the first plausible-looking one | Force all ≥3 hypotheses through the full evidence chain; no mid-way abandonment |
| **Anchoring effect** | Anchored by the first piece of info / first stack trace | Before phase S denoising completes, forming hypotheses is forbidden |
| **Correlation as causation** | A and B co-occur, therefore A causes B | Demand a mechanistic explanation (by what mechanism does A cause B) + hunt for counterexamples |

## Output format

The complete SOAP diagnosis report + evidence-chain table + logic-chain diagram + debate handoff package — templates are in [reference.md](reference.md).

The final deliverable of this skill is a **diagnosis report**, not a fix plan. The report must end with the note "This report covers diagnosis only and has not entered the resolution phase."

## Red Flags (non-intuitive traps)

- ❌ Skipping S and jumping to hypotheses — forming hypotheses on un-denoised information is building on noise
- ❌ Mixing inferences into evidence collection — inferences treated as facts pollute the evidence chain and become hard to trace
- ❌ Building an evidence chain only for the most likely hypothesis — leaving the others unfinished = premature convergence, exactly what this skill fights
- ❌ A logic chain longer than 5 steps with no intermediate evidence — long reasoning chains are a hotbed of hallucination; every step needs an anchor
- ❌ Failing to identify the weakest links before orchestrating debate — debate loses its targets and becomes empty argument
- ❌ Treating this skill as a repair tool — after delivering the diagnosis report, if the user wants a fix, hand off to `solve-workflow` or a specialized skill
